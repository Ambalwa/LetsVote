## Dependency Management
# For every project (major and minor) there are usually a set functionalities
# that will be too tedious to implement. This is the reason why libraries are 
# used. Libraries are basically collections of code which help doing a particular
# easier e.g. connecting to a database, connecting to hardware devices etc.
# The most basic way of adding libraries to a java project, is by adding the
# respect .jar file of the library file into libs the folder. This workes for
# small projects, however, when moving to larger projects. It becomes a bother!!
# This is the reason why dependency management tools were written. You may be 
# familiar with such tools from other languages such pip for python, npm for
# nodejs etc. In Java, there are two main dependency management tools: gradle 
# and maven. Depending on the presence of certain files, one can tell which 
# tool is being used. For your first task, you are to:
1. Identify which dependency management tool is being used.
2. Add the following to dependencies to the dependency file [Make sure your put
    them in the right place.]
    - hibernate-core [latest]
    - mysql-connector-java [latest]


NOTE: Check the dependencies folder in project view to see if you've added them
correctly
